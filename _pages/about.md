Hi! I'm Jay ðŸ‘‹, a CS undergrad from Mumbai University. I started my programming career with C language in 2017. I have fluency in programming languages like C, Python and JavaScript. I have been working on solving problems using ML for over a year now. I'm currently working as a research intern at University of California San Diego under Dr. Pengtao Xie on applying humans' learning skills for Neural Architecture Search.

Current areas of interests:
- Multimodal machine learning (Language and Vision Intersection)
- Fairness and bias in language models
- Interpretability

Independent research projects:
- Worked on the task of visual dialog with the aim of reducing the bias towards dialog history using mixed attention mechanisms as a part of final year project (Accepted at [ICACDS 2021](https://icacds.com/)).
- Co-authored a paper on using object detection and image processing techniques to estimate the dimension of potholes (Published at [IVCNZ 2020](https://ecs.wgtn.ac.nz/Events/IVCNZ2020/)).
- Co-authored a chapter titled "Combatting COVID-19 using Object Detection Techniques" for Elsevier's CPS-AI & COVID-19 book (Accepted).
- Co-authored papers on using IoT and ML effectively to automate tasks in agriculture and waste management sectors.

You can find more about the publications on [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lNn2qGoAAAAJ&hl=en).

I have previously worked as a ML project intern at Tata Consultancy Services where I got the opportunity to work on understanding customer behavior using NLP. I have also collaborated with Dr. Pratik Kanani on a industry project focusing on anamoly detection in heart rate (pulse) using IoT and ML. I also led a team that developed a platform for conducting C programming examination in the college for over 500 students ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn7lwJoYfuU)).

I'm also working as a mentor at [DJ Unicode](https://github.com/djunicode) an open source organization by our college department where I help juniors on software development projects and as well as learn new stuffs too ðŸ˜€.
